<p>These to the glory and praise of the green land<br />
That bred my women, and that holds my dead,<br />
<span class="smcap"><i>England</i></span>, and with her the 
strong broods that stand<br />
Wherever her fighting lines are thrust or spread!<br />
They call us proud?&mdash;Look at our English Rose!<br />
Shedders of blood?&mdash;Where hath our own been spared?<br />
Shopkeepers?&mdash;Our accompt the high <span

Close?&mdash;In our bounty half the world hath shared.<br />
They hate us, and they envy?&nbsp; Envy and hate<br />
Should drive them to the <span 
class="smcap"><i>Pit&rsquo;s</i></span> edge?&mdash;Be it so!<br 
/>
That race is damned which misesteems its fate;<br />
And this, in <span class="smcap"><i>God&rsquo;s</i></span> good 
time, they all shall know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And know you too, you good green <span

<h3>ENVOY</h3>
<p><i>My songs were once of the sunrise</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>They shouted it over the bar</i>;<br />
<i>First-footing the dawns</i>, <i>they flourished</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And flamed with the morning star</i>.</p>
<p><i>My songs are now of the sunset</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Their brows are touched with light</i>,<br />
<i>But their feet are lost in the shadows</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And wet with the dews of night</i>.</p>
<p><i>Yet for the joy in their making</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Take them</i>, <i>O fond and true</i>,<br />
<i>And for his sake who made them</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Let them be dear to You</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Largo espressivo</i></p>
<p>In sumptuous chords, and strange,<br />
Through rich yet poignant harmonies:<br />
Subtle and strong browns, reds<br />
Magnificent with death and the pride of death,<br />
Thin, clamant greens<br />
And delicate yellows that exhaust<br />
The exquisite chromatics of decay:<br />
From ruining gardens, from reluctant woods&mdash;<br />
Dear, multitudinously reluctant woods!&mdash;<br />
And sering margents, forced<br />
To be lean and bare and perished grace by grace,<br />
And flower by flower discharmed,<br />
Comes, to a purpose none,<br />
Not even the Scorner, which is the Fool, can blink,<br />
The dead-march of the year.</p>
<p>Dead things and dying!&nbsp; Now the long-laboured soul<br />
Listens, and pines.&nbsp; But never a note of hope<br />
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>Sounds: whether in those high,<br />
Transcending unisons of resignation<br />
That speed the sovran sun,<br />
As he goes southing, weakening, minishing,<br />
Almighty in obedience; or in those<br />
Small, sorrowful colloquies<br />
Of bronze and russet and gold,<br />
Colour with colour, dying things with dead,<br />
That break along this visual orchestra:<br />
As in that other one, the audible,<br />
Horn answers horn, hautboy and violin<br />
Talk, and the &rsquo;cello calls the clarionet<br />
And flute, and the poor heart is glad.<br />
There is no hope in these&mdash;only despair.</p>
<p>Then, destiny in act, ensues<br />
That most tremendous passage in the score:<br />
When hangman rains and winds have wrought<br />
Their worst, and, the brave lights gone down,<br />
The low strings, the brute brass, the sullen drums<br />
Sob, grovel, and curse themselves<br />
Silent. . . .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the spirit of Man<br />
And on the heart of the World there falls<br />
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>A strange, half-desperate peace:<br />
A war-worn, militant, gray jubilance<br />
In the unkind, implacable tyranny<br />
Of Winter, the obscene,<br />
Old, crapulous Regent, who in his loins&mdash;<br />
O, who but feels he carries in his loins<br />
The wild, sweet-blooded, wonderful harlot, Spring?</p>
<h3><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>I.</h3>
<p>Low&mdash;low<br />
Over a perishing after-glow,<br />
A thin, red shred of moon<br />
Trailed.&nbsp; In the windless air<br />
The poplars all ranked lean and chill.<br />
The smell of winter loitered there,<br />
And the Year&rsquo;s heart felt still.<br />
Yet not so far away<br />
Seemed the mad Spring,<br />
But that, as lovers will,<br />
I let my laughing heart go play,<br />
As it had been a fond maid&rsquo;s frolicking;<br />
And, turning thrice the gold I&rsquo;d got,<br />
In the good gloom<br />
Solemnly wished me&mdash;what?<br />
What, and with whom?</p>
<h3><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>II</h3>
<p>Moon of half-candied meres<br />
And flurrying, fading snows;<br />
Moon of unkindly rains,<br />
Wild skies, and troubled vanes;<br />
When the Norther snarls and bites,<br />
And the lone moon walks a-cold,<br />
And the lawns grizzle o&rsquo; nights,<br />
And wet fogs search the fold:<br />
Here in this heart of mine<br />
A dream that warms like wine,<br />
A dream one other knows,<br />
Moon of the roaring weirs<br />
And the sip-sopping close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; February Fill-Dyke,<br />
Shapes like a royal rose&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A red, red rose!</p>
<p>O, but the distance clears!<br />
O, but the daylight grows!<br />
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>Soon shall the pied wind-flowers<br />
Babble of greening hours,<br />
Primrose and daffodil<br />
Yearn to a fathering sun,<br />
The lark have all his will,<br />
The thrush be never done,<br />
And April, May, and June<br />
Go to the same blythe tune<br />
As this blythe dream of mine!<br />
Moon when the crocus peers,<br />
Moon when the violet blows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; February Fair-Maid,<br />
Haste, and let come the rose&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let come the rose!</p>
<h3><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>The night dislimns, and breaks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like snows slow thawn;<br />
An evil wind awakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On lea and lawn;<br />
The low East quakes; and hark!<br />
Out of the kindless dark,<br />
A fierce, protesting lark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High in the horror of dawn!</p>
<p>A shivering streak of light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A scurry of rain:<br />
Bleak day from bleaker night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creeps pinched and fain;<br />
The old gloom thins and dies,<br />
And in the wretched skies<br />
A new gloom, sick to rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprawls, like a thing in pain.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>And yet, what matter&mdash;say!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shuddering trees,<br />
The Easter-stricken day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sodden leas?<br />
The good bird, wing and wing<br />
With Time, finds heart to sing,<br />
As he were hastening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The swallow o&rsquo;er the seas.</p>
<h3><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>IV</h3>
<p>It came with the year&rsquo;s first crocus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a world of winds and snows&mdash;<br />
Because it would, because it must,<br />
Because of life and time and lust;<br />
And a year&rsquo;s first crocus served my turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as the year&rsquo;s first rose.</p>
<p>The March rack hurries and hectors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The March dust heaps and blows;<br />
But the primrose flouts the daffodil,<br />
And here&rsquo;s the patient violet still;<br />
And the year&rsquo;s first crocus brought me luck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So hey for the year&rsquo;s first rose!</p>
<h3><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>The good South-West on sea-worn wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes shepherding the good rain;<br />
The brave Sea breaks, and glooms, and swings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A weltering, glittering plain.</p>
<p>Sound, Sea of England, sound and shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow, English Wind, amain,<br />
Till in this old, gray heart of mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spring need wake again!</p>
<h3><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>In the red April dawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wild April weather,<br />
From brake and thicket and lawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds sing all together.</p>
<p>The look of the hoyden Spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is pinched and shrewish and cold;<br />
But all together they sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a world that can never be old:</p>
<p>Of a world still young&mdash;still young!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose last word won&rsquo;t be said,<br />
Nor her last song dreamed and sung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till her last true lover&rsquo;s dead!</p>
<h3><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>VII</h3>
<p>The April sky sags low and drear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The April winds blow cold,<br />
The April rains fall gray and sheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yeanlings keep the fold.</p>
<p>But the rook has built, and the song-birds quire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the faded lea<br />
The lark soars glorying, gyre on gyre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he is the bird for me!</p>
<p>For he sings as if from his watchman&rsquo;s height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw, this blighting day,<br />
The far vales break into colour and light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the banners and arms of May.</p>

<p>Shadow and gleam on the Downland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the low Spring sky,<br />
Shadow and gleam in my spirit&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>A bird, in his nest rejoicing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers and flatters and woos:<br />
A fresh voice flutters my fancy&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose?</p>
<p>And the humour of April frolics<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bickers in blade and bough&mdash;<br />
O, to meet for the primal kindness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now!</p>
<h3><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>The wind on the wold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sea-scents and sea-dreams attended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wine!<br />
The air is as gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In elixir&mdash;it takes so the splendid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunshine!</p>
<p>O, the larks in the blue!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How the song of them glitters, and glances,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gleams!<br />
The old music sounds new&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s O, the wild Spring, and his 
chances<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dreams!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lift in the blood&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O, this gracious, and thirsting, and aching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unrest!<br />
All life&rsquo;s at the bud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my heart, full of April, is breaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My breast.</p>
<h3><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Deep in my gathering garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A gallant thrush has built;<br />
And his quaverings on the stillness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like light made song are spilt.</p>
<p>They gleam, they glint, they sparkle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They glitter along the air,<br />
Like the song of a sunbeam netted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a tangle of red-gold hair.</p>
<p>And I long, as I laugh and listen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the angel-hour that shall bring<br />
My part, pre-ordained and appointed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the miracle of Spring.</p>
<h3><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>What doth the blackbird in the boughs<br />
Sing all day to his nested spouse?<br />
What but the song of his old Mother-Earth,<br />
In her mighty humour of lust and mirth?<br />
&lsquo;Love and God&rsquo;s will go wing and wing,<br />
And as for death, is there any such thing?&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
In the shadow of death,<br />
So, at the beck of the wizard Spring<br />
The dear bird saith&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So the bird saith!</p>
<p>Caught with us all in the nets of fate,<br />
So the sweet wretch sings early and late;<br />
And, O my fairest, after all,<br />
The heart of the World&rsquo;s in his innocent call.<br />
The will of the World&rsquo;s with him wing and wing:&mdash;<br 
/>
&lsquo;Life&mdash;life&mdash;life!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the sole 
great thing<br />
This side of death,<br />
Heart on heart in the wonder of Spring!&rsquo;<br />
So the bird saith&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wise bird saith!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world, all hoary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With song and story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolls in a glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of youth and mirth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above and under<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clothed on with wonder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunrise and thunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And death and birth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His broods befriending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With grace unending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gifts transcending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A god&rsquo;s at play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet do his meetness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sovran sweetness<br />
Hold in the jocund purpose of May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So take your pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in full measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of your treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When birds sing best!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp; When winds blow cleanest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seas roll sheenest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lawns lie greenest:<br />

To them that praise Him, praising His May.</p>

<p><i>I talked one midnight with the jolly ghost</i><br />

<p>All in a garden green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrushes were singing;<br />
Red rose and white between,<br />

It was the merry May;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet sang my Lady:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Nay, Sweet, now nay, now nay!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then to a pleasant shade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I did invite her:<br />
All things a concert made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to delight her;<br />

<p>Why do you linger and loiter, O most sweet?<br />
Why do you falter and delay,<br />
Now that the insolent, high-blooded May<br />
Comes greeting and to greet?<br />
Comes with her instant summonings to stray<br />
Down the green, antient way&mdash;<br />
The leafy, still, rose-haunted, eye-proof street!&mdash;<br />
Where true lovers each other may entreat,<br />
Ere the gold hair turn gray?<br />
Entreat, and fleet<br />
Life gaudily, and so play out their play,<br />
Even with the triumphing May&mdash;<br />
The young-eyed, smiling, irresistible May!</p>
<p>Why do you loiter and linger, O most dear?<br />
Why do you dream and palter and stay,<br />
When every dawn, that rushes up the bay,<br />
Brings nearer, and more near,<br />
The Terror, the Discomforter, whose prey,<br />

tear,<br />
Lets his arraignment; but we disappear,<br />
What time the gold turns gray,<br />
Into the sheer,<br />
Blind gulfs unglutted of mere Yesterday,<br />
With the unlingering May&mdash;<br />
The good, fulfilling, irresponsible May!</p>

The magical drifts to north and eastward rolled,<br />
The shining sands, the still, transfigured sea,<br />
The wind so light it scarce begins to be,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s rose in me.</p>

<p>Love, which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb.<br />
Love, which is lust, is the Call from the Gloom.</p>
<p>Love, which is lust, is the Main of Desire.<br />
Love, which is lust, is the Centric Fire.</p>
<p>So man and woman will keep their trust,<br />
Till the very Springs of the Sea run dust.</p>
<p>Yea, each with the other will lose and win,<br />
Till the very Sides of the Grave fall in.</p>
<p>For the strife of Love&rsquo;s the abysmal strife,<br />
And the word of Love is the Word of Life.</p>
<p>And they that go with the Word unsaid,<br />
Though they seem of the living, are damned and dead.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dawn of a summer day,<br />
We caught at a mood as it passed in flight,<br />

And what with the dawn of night began<br />

<p>Silence, loneliness, darkness&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These, and of these my fill,<br />
While God in the rush of the Maytide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without is working His will.</p>
<p>Without are the wind and the wall-flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaves and the nests and the rain,<br />
And in all of them God is making<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His beautiful purpose plain.</p>
<p>But I wait in a horror of strangeness&mdash;<br />

Whose part in the world has been dreamed out and done:<br />
One that hath fairly earned and spent<br />
In pride of heart and jubilance of blood<br />
Such wages, be they counted bad or good,<br />
As Time, the old taskmaster, was moved to pay;<br />
And, having warred and suffered, and passed on<br />
Those gifts the Arbiters preferred and gave,<br />
Fare, grateful and content,<br />
Down the dim way<br />
Whereby races innumerable have gone,<br />
Into the silent universe of the grave.</p>
<p>Grateful for what hath been&mdash;<br />
For what my hand hath done, mine eyes have seen,<br />
My heart been privileged to know;<br />

To lips that yearned in love to them, and wrought<br />
In the way of wrath, and pity, and sport, and song:<br />
Content, this miracle of being alive<br />
Dwindling, that I, thrice weary of worst and best,<br />
May shed my duds, and go<br />
From right and wrong,<br />
And, ceasing to regret, and long, and strive,<br />
Accept the past, and be for ever at rest.</p>

<p>Spoken by Mr. <span class="smcap">Tree</span> in the character
of Beau Austin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To all and singular,&rsquo; as <span 
class="smcap"><i>Dryden</i></span> says,<br />
We bring a fancy of those Georgian days,<br />
Whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume<br />
Of old-world courtliness and old-world bloom:<br />
When speech was elegant and talk was fit,<br />
For slang had not been canonised as wit;<br />
When manners reigned, when breeding had the wall,<br />
And Women&mdash;yes!&mdash;were ladies first of all;<br />
When Grace was conscious of its gracefulness,<br />
And man&mdash;though Man!&mdash;was not ashamed to dress.<br />
A brave formality, a measured ease<br />
Were his&mdash;and hers&mdash;whose effort was to please.<br />
And to excel in pleasing was to reign,<br />
And, if you sighed, never to sigh in vain.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 90</span>But then, as now&mdash;it may be, 
something more&mdash;<br />
Woman and man were human to the core.<br />
The hearts that throbbed behind that brave attire<br />
Burned with a plenitude of essential fire.<br />
They too could risk, they also could rebel:<br />
They could love wisely&mdash;they could love too well.<br />
In that great duel of Sex, that ancient strife<br />
Which is the very central fact of life,<br />
They could&mdash;and did&mdash;engage it breath for breath,<br />
They could&mdash;and did&mdash;get wounded unto death.<br />
As at all times since time for us began<br />
Woman was truly woman, man was man,<br />
And joy and sorrow were as much at home<br />
In trifling <span class="smcap"><i>Tunbridge</i></span> as in 
mighty <span class="smcap"><i>Rome</i></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead&mdash;dead and done with!&nbsp; Swift 
from shine to shade<br />
The roaring generations flit and fade.<br />
To this one, fading, flitting, like the rest,<br />
We come to proffer&mdash;be it worst or best&mdash;<br />
A sketch, a shadow, of one brave old time;<br />
A hint of what it might have held sublime;<br />
A dream, an idyll, call it what you will,<br />
Of man still Man, and woman&mdash;Woman still!</p>

Our purpose is an essay in romance:<br />
An old-world story where such old-world facts<br />
As hate and love and death, through four swift acts&mdash;<br />
Not without gleams and glances, hints and cues,<br />
From the dear bright eyes of the Comic Muse!&mdash;<br />
So shine and sound that, as we fondly deem,<br />
They may persuade you to accept our dream:<br />
Our own invention, mainly&mdash;though we take,<br />
Somewhat for art but most for interest&rsquo;s sake<br />
One for our hero who goes wandering still<br />
In the long shadow of <span class="smcap"><i>Parnassus

Scarce within eyeshot; but his tragic shade<br />
Compels that recognition due be made,<br />

Marked for reproaches from his life&rsquo;s beginning;<br />

Yet, ere his ghost we raise<br />
For these more decent and less desperate days,<br />
It may be well and seemly to reflect<br />
That, howbeit of so prodigal a sect,<br />
Since it was his to call until the end<br />
Our greatest, wisest Englishman his friend,<br />
&rsquo;Twere all-too fatuous if we cursed and scorned<br />

Not as he was but as he might have been<br />
Had the Unkind Gods been poets of the scene,<br />
Fired with our fancy, shaped and tricked anew<br />
To touch your hearts with love, your eyes with rue,<br />

<h3>TWO DAYS<br />
(<i>February</i> 15&mdash;<i>September</i> 28, 1894)</h3>
<p><i>To</i> V. G.</p>
<p>That day we brought our Beautiful One to lie<br />
In the green peace within your gates, he came<br />
To give us greeting, boyish and kind and shy,<br />
And, stricken as we were, we blessed his name:<br />
Yet, like the Creature of Light that had been ours,<br />
Soon of the sweet Earth disinherited,<br />
He too must join, even with the Year&rsquo;s old flowers,<br />
The unanswering generations of the Dead.<br />
So stand we friends for you, who stood our friend<br />
Through him that day; for now through him you know<br />
That though where love was, love is till the end,<br />
Love, turned of death to longing, like a foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strikes: when the ruined heart goes forth to 
crave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy of the high, austere, unpitying Grave.</p>

THOMAS EDWARD BROWN</h3>
<p>(<i>Ob. October</i> 30, 1897)</p>
<p>He looked half-parson and half-skipper: a quaint,<br />
Beautiful blend, with blue eyes good to see,<br />
And old-world whiskers.&nbsp; You found him cynic, saint,<br />
Salt, humourist, Christian, poet; with a free,<br />
Far-glancing, luminous utterance; and a heart<br />
Large as <span class="smcap"><i>St. Francis&rsquo;s</i></span>: 
withal a brain<br />
Stored with experience, letters, fancy, art,<br />
And scored with runes of human joy and pain.<br />
Till six-and-sixty years he used his gift,<br />
His gift unparalleled, of laughter and tears,<br />
And left the world a high-piled, golden drift<br />
Of verse: to grow more golden with the years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the Great Silence fallen upon his ways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Break into song, and he that had Love have 
Praise.</p>

Blow, you bugles of <span class="smcap"><i>England</i></span>,

These are gone whither all must go,<br />
Mightily gone from the field they won.<br />
So in the workaday wear of battle,<br />
Touched to glory with <span

In a rapture of wrath and faith and pride,<br />

For whose dear sake their triumphing souls they shed,<br />
Blow, you bugles of <span class="smcap"><i>England</i></span>,

Though you break the heart of her beaten foe,<br />
Glory and praise to the everlasting Mother,<br />
Glory and peace to her lovely and faithful dead!</p>

self,<br />

With toil for the race, and pain, and peril, and death!<br />
Tears, and the dread, tremendous dirge<br />

<p>Into a land<br />
Storm-wrought, a place of quakes, all thunder-scarred,<br />
Helpless, degraded, desolate,<br />
Peace, the White Angel, comes.<br />
Her eyes are as a mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her good hands<br />
Are comforting, and helping; and her voice<br />
Falls on the heart, as, after Winter, Spring<br />
Falls on the World, and there is no more pain.<br />
And, in her influence, hope returns, and life,<br />
And the passion of endeavour: so that, soon,<br />
The idle ports are insolent with keels;<br />
The stithies roar, and the mills thrum<br />
With energy and achievement; weald and wold<br />
Exult; the cottage-garden teems<br />
With innocent hues and odours; boy and girl<br />
Mate prosperously; there are sweet women to kiss;<br />
There are good women to breed.&nbsp; In a golden fog,<br />
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>A large, full-stomached faith in kindliness<br />
All over the world, the nation, in a dream<br />
Of money and love and sport, hangs at the paps<br />
Of well-being, and so<br />
Goes fattening, mellowing, dozing, rotting down<br />
Into a rich deliquium of decay.</p>
<p>Then, if the Gods be good,<br />
Then, if the Gods be other than mischievous,<br />
Down from their footstools, down<br />
With a million-throated shouting, swoops and storms<br />
War, the Red Angel, the Awakener,<br />
The Shaker of Souls and Thrones; and at her heel<br />
Trail grief, and ruin, and shame!<br />
The woman weeps her man, the mother her son,<br />
The tenderling its father.&nbsp; In wild hours,<br />
A people, haggard with defeat,<br />
Asks if there be a God; yet sets its teeth,<br />
Faces calamity, and goes into the fire<br />
Another than it was.&nbsp; And in wild hours<br />
A people, roaring ripe<br />
With victory, rises, menaces, stands renewed,<br />
Sheds its old piddling aims,<br />
<!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

The comfortable dream, and goes,<br />
Armoured and militant,<br />
New-pithed, new-souled, new-visioned, up the steeps<br />
To those great altitudes, whereat the weak<br />
Live not.&nbsp; But only the strong<br />
Have leave to strive, and suffer, and achieve.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
